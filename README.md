The project was focused for the Wintersemester Deep Learning with assignment for Uni Konstanz from Sotirios Gkosdis. The dataset, that was used was the Semtiment Analysis 
for mental health. The model was overfitting, despite the experimenting that was done, while the confusion matrixes scores were good. Thios was only a static aproach using the 
Glove-Wiki embeddings.
